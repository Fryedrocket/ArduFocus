ArduFocser
ArduFocser is an open-source firmware for Arduino Nano-based motorized focusers, designed for telescope automation. It provides precise control of a stepper motor via serial commands and supports integration with ASCOM drivers for remote operation. The firmware is highly configurable and supports features such as EEPROM settings storage, temperature monitoring, and LED status indication.

Features
Stepper Motor Control: Move to absolute or relative positions, set speed, acceleration, and microstepping.
EEPROM Storage: Persistent storage of configuration and position.
Temperature Monitoring: Periodic temperature readings for compensation.
ASCOM Integration: Serial protocol compatible with ASCOM drivers.
Status LEDs: Visual feedback for connection and movement status.
Robust Serial Command Interface: For both manual and automated control.
Hardware Connections
Arduino Nano Pin	Function	Description
D2	DiagPin	Diagnostic input
D3	DirPin	Stepper direction
D4	RXPin	Serial RX (optional)
D5	TXPin	Serial TX (optional)
D6	MS2Pin	Microstep select
D7	MS1Pin	Microstep select
D8	EnablePin	Stepper enable
D10	StepPin	Stepper step

Note: Connect the stepper driver (e.g., TMC2209) to the corresponding pins. LEDs for status indication should be connected to InLEDPin and OutLEDPin as defined in BoardDefinitions.h.

Serial Communication
Overview
Communication is performed over the Arduino's serial port (default 115200 baud). Commands are sent as ASCII strings and terminated with a semicolon ;. Each command can include parameters, typically separated by curly braces {}.

Example:
SM{100}; â€” Move focuser by 100 steps.

Command Structure
Command: 2-3 letter code (e.g., SM, GP)
Parameters: Enclosed in {} (optional)
Terminator: ;

ASCOM Driver Integration
Connect Arduino Nano to your PC via USB.
Install ASCOM Platform and the appropriate ASCOM driver for ArduFocser.
Configure the COM port in the ASCOM driver settings to match your Arduino Nano.
Use your astronomy software (e.g., NINA, SGP, APT) to connect to the focuser via ASCOM.
The ASCOM driver communicates with the firmware using the serial protocol described above, sending commands and parsing responses to control and monitor the focuser.

Methods and Architecture
Command Parsing:
The firmware parses incoming serial data, extracting commands and parameters, and dispatches them to handler functions.
Timers:
Uses timer events for periodic tasks (temperature reading, EEPROM updates, connection checks).
EEPROM Management:
Settings and position are periodically saved to EEPROM for persistence.
Status LEDs:
Indicate connection and movement status for user feedback.
Interrupts:
Global interrupts are enabled for responsive operation.
Building and Uploading
Install PlatformIO (https://platformio.org/) in VS Code.
Connect your Arduino Nano via USB.
Build and upload the firmware using PlatformIO's interface or CLI: pio run --target upload
